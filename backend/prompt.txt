Context: We are Wizeline, a Software Development Company. We have a project profile that needs exploiting to get farming opportunities with the client. The project profile is a merged profile from multiple sources about a project. 
        
        Client Name: KPMG
        Project Name: multirag
        
        Review, expand and refine this merged project profile to ensure coherence and completeness.
        The profile contains information gathered from multiple sources about a project.
        The goal is to generate insights and offerings that can be used to cross-sell or farm more projects with the client.

        Your task is to:
        1. Ensure consistency across all sections
        2. Remove any contradictions
        3. Combine similar items in lists
        4. Fill in obvious gaps based on available information
        5. Refine and expand on items to improve clarity.
        6. Ensure technical keywords and solution descriptions are accurate
        7. Make sure pain points and opportunities align
        8. Verify that the technical landscape matches the project description
        9. Generate very relevant hypothetical offerings ideas for cross-selling/farming more projects with the client in the hypothetical_offerings keys based on what we know would really help the client.

        Important guidelines:
        - Maintain factual accuracy
        - Preserve specific technical details and names
        - Keep the same structure and format
        - Ensure all dates and timelines are consistent
        - Make relationships between different sections clear
        - Standardize terminology throughout
        - Focus on opportunities
